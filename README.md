# Pricing_Optimization_AB_Test_Analysis
This notebook analyzes data from an A/B test for pricing optimization.

### Three main questions are addressed:
1) At which price should the company list their software? <br>
2) What attributes of customer behavior influence conversion rate? <br>
3) How long should the experiment have taken? <br>

### The results are summarized below:
<br>
1) The company had a higher conversion rate for lower priced software. However, the difference in conversion rates did not outweigh the revenue generated by the higher priced software. Therefore, the company should list their software at a higher price.<br>
<br>
2) The top three sources of the highest conversion rates were: 1) Friend Referral,  2) Seo-bing, 3) Ads-google. The company could invest more in these domains given that they work and eliminate sources with low conversion rates, or rethink the strategy for sources with low conversion rates. In addition, windows and android users are less likely to convert, and a targeted marketing approach should be implemented towards these groups. <br>
<br>
3) Based on a power analysis, the experiment could have been conducted in 5 days with 34,578 users. However, I would recommend 2 weeks due to variations in user activity based on day of the week.
